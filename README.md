## Car object ðŸš—

From my daily life I chose my car as an object, because I'm using this everyday.

### This object has the following properties and values:

**Type:** This has nested object properties:

### Additional feautures

I've added a function for a start button(toggle) that displays some of the values in the object in the html elements, this will update by clicking the start button.

I've also added buttons for shifting gears that displays the gear value and gear ratio value in the html with the respective gear, this will be updated by clicking the different gear-buttons.
